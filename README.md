# Sams Webs

This is iteration 4 of this website, with versions 2 and 3 never having been seen publicly.

Cobbled together with old Markdowns I wrote in the 1st quarter of 2023 and [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).  Hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  

In case you were wondering:  edited using [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org).
